# Analysis of Technical Report

## Overarching Bullshit Issues
- BE CONSISTENT IN REFERENCES (Examples)
	- ferric iron
	- ferrous iron
	- apotransferrin (uTf), dont say unbound transferrin
	- holotransferrin (bTf), 	dont say bound transferrin
	- heme -> Hemoglobin (Hgb) -> red blood cells (RBC)
	- Plasma or Hematocrit (dont casually say blood unless necessary)
	- Examples of Errors	
		- referring to Pulmonary Cappillaries box as bloodstream
		- referring to fluid buildup as pus, purulent fluid, fluid
- JUSTIFY (if you say we assumed, we decided... explain why we did that, if you dont know add it to a list, mark it, and give the person who worked on it the list of questions. dont ask one at a time)
- Don't be redundant. They want you to value every word like it's your last.
	- (e.g. the purulent fluid flow rate in the pneumonic state... redundant bc 
- References are number based... [1] for single, [2-4] for multiple or [2, 3, 4] if not a range

## Executive Summary (Abstract)
- specify exactly how many people are dealing with it (it's a prevalent disease... to how many people?, active)
- specific "disease state" explain it in detail. what is impacted? why is it bad? what interventinos are there?
 
## Introduction
- Background
- Justify the necessity of the model
- Provide clinical signifiance of health situation and human health situation
- contextualize why a model is important for blood loss and menorrhagia 

## Development of Model
- Dont dedicate a heading to a value
- Exclude. Don't talk about results or discuss. Only focus on methodology.
- Do not make the graph title the same as the figure caption. Pick one.
- Don't just say literature values. That says nothing. You need to add a reference: like, the diseased distance is 0.97 Âµm [5].
- Graphs should go from 0 to ymax.
- Don't have a legend for a graph with one line.
- Significant species, chemical substitutnets rationalization. Act like they have no intuition.
	- Why apotransferrin? Why holotransferrin? Why iron? Why heme? Why hemoglobin? Why ferritin? 
	- Why stomach?
	- Why iron binding?
	- Why bone marrow for heme synthesis? 
	- Why?
- Alignment of text after a formula insertion (**dont indent**)
- Increase. Decrease. rates. values. (SPECIFY THE VALUE. Don't say refer to something. Andrew and others want a specific number)
- For mathematical equations
	- Establish common references early (e.g. molar flow rates are n dot)
	- Establish governing equations early (e.g. IN - OUT + GEN - CONS = ACC)
	- Make sure all variable names are defined .
	- Specify whether a value is found from literature [L] or calculated [C]
- For graphs
	- Comparisons or related things should have the same scale

## implications
- make sure to mention any clinical significance or impact on reserach/therapeutic efforts

## Strengths and Limitations
- be careful about making vague comments. everything needs to be explicit and justify any decisions. 

## Conclusion
- Clearly summarize key points
- Don't restate our model does this and that or it's streams. They know already.  Just summarize all the key points of the article. Whoever writes this needs to either 1) create a skeleton for each subheading (i.e. 2 sentences here about model development, etc.) to write one to two sentences. thus their role would be to reword each chunk written by team members such that the conclusion is a cohesive unit or 2) understand every aspect of the report and list all key points themselves.
	- In my opinion, all the conclusion writer has to do is be the integrator, not the scribe here. Don't try and summarize the article if you don't understand a section unless you want to feel the wrath of saterbak and the team at piss poor performance.
